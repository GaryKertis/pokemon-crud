# Requirements

- You can visit a `/new` page, which will allow you to add a new pokemon to your pokedex by typing its name.
- You can visit `/pokemon/:id` and see the individual pokemon **IF it's in the pokedex.**
- Clicking on a pokemon icon on the `index` page will take you to that pokemon's detail page.
  - You can also edit the pokemon's nickname.
- You can delete a pokemon from the pokedex by clicking a delete button on the index page..

# Stretch / Bonus / Discussion

- What would this look like if we wanted to support multiple pokedexes?
- What would this look like if we wanted to assign a pokedex to a trainer?
